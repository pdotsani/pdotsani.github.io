  <p>This graph is misleading because the Y axis is flipped, with the 0 mark at the top instead of the bottom. This
    makes the chart confusing, misleading the viewer to think that an increase in the slope would be an increase in gun deaths.</p>

  <p>This revision of the gun deaths data is not misleading because the y axis starts at 0. Here we can see
    that the gun deaths have increased based on the data provided. It is not decieving the viewer by trying to show
    the gun deaths are increasing despite the law enacted. The given data with propper formatting shows this
    anyways. <em>Made in tableau</em></p>
